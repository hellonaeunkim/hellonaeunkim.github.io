  - **Explain**
I'm going to use a dictionary and store indexes and values the number list. Then I can use those stored values to look up and see whether out current value plus anything that's stored will equal the target and if it does I can just immediately return what those indexes are and that should allow us to go through the number array only once find the solution but we will but have to have a little bit more memory usage because I'll going to have to store some numbers but see how I do this. First, I need to define just an empty dictionary to store things in. So I'll say 'sene' which is the numbers that we've been so far and now I'll going to have to loop through the numbers again. So, well mabye use enumerate this time because we want the index but also the number and we don't need to stop like at any specific point like we did with the first example. We just want to do all the numbers all at once. So, we'll just go through everything for index and num in enumerate nums so enumerate gets you both the index and the value at the same time.
First, we need to check whether the dictionary 'sene' contains the number we'd need to add to our current number that makes it equal the target. The number we'd have to add to the current number, you get the target would be the target minus the current number. So, if the target minus the current number is in the 'sene' dictionary, then we can exit and return the
